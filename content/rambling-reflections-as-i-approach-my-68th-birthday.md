As I approach my 68th birthday, I presume that I have reached the point where I
am considered a "senior martial artist". 
Reflecting on my 30 or so years of Aikido 
training, I have noticed that all people age, some 
slowly in good health and others quickly and in 
ill health. I've never been fanatical about my 
age or aging, as I consider it a natural part of 
life. Although some people try, there is just no 
escaping it. To age we must! I do my best to 
try to keep myself as physically and mentally 
active as my health and circumstances will 
allow, which is really the best anyone can do. 
With years of diligent practice, the principles of 
Aikido you develop, spill over into your daily 
life, resulting in a more relaxed, focused, and 
peaceful outlook at life in general, which keeps 
your body much more flexible, and less likely to 
suffer injuries as we age. I strongly believe that 
this is the key to a long and healthy life. 

What exactly is Aikido? It is really hard 
to describe in print. To fully understand what it 
is, you really have to actually see it practiced. 
Aikido is not a sport. It is a discipline, an 
educational process for training the mind, body 
and spirit. Other "Martial Arts" are very 
confrontational in style, with participants 
trading punches, kicks and blocks, with the 
intention of harming each other. I jokingly like 
to refer to Aikido as "Peaceful Violence". The 
mindset you develop in Aikido is not one of  
confrontation, but of a peaceful approach to any 
confrontation. Rather than respond to any 
attack or confrontation directed at us with the 
same violence, an Aikidoka will strive to 
redirect any attack away from or around them, 
with the intention of not harming our attacker, 
but at the same time being able to protect 
ourselves and control any attacker without 
causing any permanent damage. 

That is not to say that I have not had my 
fair share of injuries from Aikido. Becoming a 
senior martial artist has been very enjoyable and 
very personally rewarding to me, but not easy, 
because as we age training doesn't get any 
easier. There have been many injuries along my 
way. An inventory would include numerable 
cuts and bruises, dislocated toes and sprained 
fingers, a dislocated shoulder, torn ligaments in 
both arms, and even worn cartilage in my knees, 
and aches and pains from old injuries or sore 
muscles. However, I think that with continuous 
training we eventually reach a point at which we 
are able to ignore these pains. I believe that 
over time, one's threshold or tolerance of pain is 
greatly elevated. I know I can have aches and 
pains here and there; but when I get on the mat 
to train or teach and transition into my "Aikido 
mind set", they seem to disappear or become 
very minor. 

Despite our desire to believe otherwise, 
we become more vulnerable to injury as we age, 
and each injury takes longer to heal. As I age, I 
have to accept this or quit training. 
Occasionally, I have been asked, "Why do you 
continue to train at your age?" My answer is 
that it is partially from habit because it is an 
important part of my life, and partially because 
of the physical and mental challenge it provides. 
And I've also been asked, "How long do you 
expect to continue to train?" My response is, 
"As long as I live and am able to!" Some 
commitments in our lives are never really 
finished; they just continue one day at a time. 
As the founder of Aikido said when he was 
much older than I am, "I am still learning".
